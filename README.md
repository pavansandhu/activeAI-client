# Project Title

ActiveAI

## Overview

ActiveAI is an app that provides structured workouts dependant on the users desired sport, fitness level, time constraints and equipment available.

### Problem Space

A common blocker preventing people from working out or getting into endurance sports like cycling, running or swimming is the lack of knowledge on how to build a structured workout. Structured workouts allow you to stay focused regardless if you have your eyes set on a race or just want to workout once or twice a week. Often workout programs available on apps are cumulative and not customizable to your needs/constraints and often extra equipment is needed to make a workout doable. This app will allow anyone to try out a sport like cycling, running or swimming.

### User Profile

-Wide range of users can include:
-people who want to workout occasionally with no commitments to a training plan or out of reach
-busy people like mom or dads trying to manage time with kids, work and health
-people wanting to try a new sport
-people getting back into fitness
-people who want to get into shape and want to keep things simple with a structured workout
-keep a record of previously completed workouts
-people who want custom workouts

### Features
